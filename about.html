            <h1>WHAT IS MENTAL HEALTH?</h1>
            <p>Mental health is a state of mental well-being that allows us to deal with the day-to-day stresses of life, work productively, and contribute to the community. Just as important as physical health, mental health is something we all have. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It is completely okay to experience a range of emotions—feeling alone, unwell, down, stressed, and angry is just as normal as feeling happy, amazed, confident, and carefree.</p>

            <h1>WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?</h1>
            <p>Sadly, despite its importance, mental health is still surrounded by stigma. Phrases like “oa ra ka”, “wala lang na uy”, or “kaartehan mo lang yan” are commonly heard. We must break these negative attitudes and beliefs about mental health as this stigma instills fear in people. They feel hesitant or discouraged to seek the professional help they need because they fear being seen, shamed, judged, and discriminated against. We are committed to raising awareness about mental health and being a source of support for those people currently struggling with their mental health.</p>
